#Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the book Computer Systems Incremental Systems Engineering and associated Laboratory for Raspberry Pi. This source code repository is organized by the chapters of the book, one (1) through (11). Each chapter is an accumulation of the chapters before it. Any change requests or bug reports should be submitted in regards to the final chapter 11 if applicable (unless bug only exists in previous chapter).

If you found this repository before the books, below are the references into Leanpub for the books. If purchasing, the bundle (last link below) is highly recommended as only the Laboratory book explains the Raspberry Pi hardware details. If purchasing the book is not possible for you or your group economically please know that the first six (6) complete chapters are available free from the links below (select the Read Free Sample in bottom left of individual book page). Feel free to contact the author and expain your situation if you cannot afford the book but wish to read the remaining chapters.
